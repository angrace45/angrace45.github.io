  <h2>Poker video</h2>
  <p>I find Studio C's video on poker very funny. The thoughts of the players of pocker are so weird and ridiculuos. </p>

  <h2>Camel's Struggle</h2>
  <p> This video shows a camel struggling to walk with a couple sitting on its box. The camel's failure to walk straight and the music for the video makes this video very funny.</p>

  <h2>Scott Sterling</h2>
  <p> The video of Scott Sterling saving the goal with his face got 89 million views because of how funny it is. I like it too.</p>
